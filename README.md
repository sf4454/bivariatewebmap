This map showcases the amount of teachers per school and the amount of schools per county in Ashe, Avery and Watauga counties. The counties layer was sourced from NCONEmap.gov and the school information was gathered on the North Carolina Department of Education Website. It came in the form of a CSV file that I significantly simplified and then converted to a geojson using geojson.io. The major functions of this map include onclick events for each school, displaying the school name, town and the number of teachers per school. Additionally, this map has a title, scale bar, and short description. It is meant to reflect the needs for k-12 education across a segment of Northwestern North Carolina, and determine if there are any areas of Ashe, Avery or Watauga counties that are underserved in terms of k-12 education availibility. The base map was sourced from leaflet.com and is the default open street map base map, while the icons were sourced from fontawesome.com.
